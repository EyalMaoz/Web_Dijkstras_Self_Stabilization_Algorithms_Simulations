# Web Dijkstra's Self Stabilization Algorithm Simulation
Following on this project -https://github.com/EyalMaoz/Dijkstras_Self_Stabilization_Algorithms_Simulations
Which was implemented in Windows Forms (C#), I decided to challenge my self to create a Web version of it.

In this web version I implemented only the the first algorithm.
